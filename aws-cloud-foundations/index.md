## 🎯 How to Pass the Course?

### Minimum Requirements to Pass the Course (Grade 1)

To earn a **minimum passing grade (1)**, you must **complete all AWS Academy modules** before **week 47**.

#### Stay on Track

- Avoid last-minute work — follow the **weekly schedule** provided if that helps you.
- You can do the modules at your own schedule as long as everything is completed before week 47.
- ⚠️ **Strict deadline**: If you miss week 47 deadline, **you will fail the course**. No exceptions.

#### Handwritten Notes for Each Video

You must create **handwritten notes** for every video in all modules. So you will need ✏️ pen and 📄 paper for this.

Why?

> Handwriting improves understanding, memory, and focus by promoting
> deeper processing, better brain activation, and reducing distractions — see [Mueller & Oppenheimer (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614524581), [Van der Meer & Van der Weel (2017)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00706), [Sana et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2012.10.003).

For each video, notes must include:

1. **The most important topics** from the video.
2. **Answers to the following questions:**
   - a) _What did you learn?_
   - b) _What was unclear?_

#### Submitting Your Notes

- Upload your notes as **PDFs** via following [form](https://forms.cloud.microsoft/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=r0Rp-nzM2EyRVMARMnmJELTaXhmZ3l1Al4wTyiKl20lUNEQ0OVZPVTBENThUTERSUzBOMUFVVFQySy4u).
- The PDF must contain **images of your handwritten notes**.
- File name format (case-sensitive):
  - `moduleXX-videoYY-lastname-firstname-notes.pdf`
  - **Examples:**
    - `module01-video01-virtanen-matti-notes.pdf`
    - `module05-video05-smith-john-notes.pdf`

> ⚠️ If the file name is incorrect, your submission will be **automatically rejected**. You must resubmit using the correct naming convention.

#### Language

You may write your notes in **Finnish or in English**.

### Higher Grades, from 2 - 5

To aim for a **higher grade (2–5)**, you must first meet the requirements for a passing grade (**1**), and then **participate in the final exam**.

You are eligible to take the exam only after completing:

- all **video notes**
- all **knowledge tests**
- all **labs**

👉 You **cannot take the exam** if the AWS Academy modules are incomplete or video notes are missing.

If you take the exam but do not pass, your final grade will remain **1**.

### Exam

- Exam is done in [`exam.tuni.fi`](https://sites.tuni.fi/exam/).
- Contains multiple choice questions.
- Consists of questions from modules `01` to `10`.
- Each module has five (`5`) questions
  - `10 modules × 5 questions = 50 questions`
- Questions are chosen randomly so **each student will get a unique exam**.
- Exam will be open in week 47 or earlier for students who have done all notes, passed all knowledge tests and labs in AWS Academy. Link for the exam is provided to students.
- You cannot have any extra material with you in the exam. Recap your notes before taking the exam.
- Retakes?
  - If you fail the exam, you can retake the exam twice.
  - If you pass the exam, you can retake the exam once.

## 💡 Tips for AWS Academy Assignments

- When starting a lab, **it may take 5-10 minutes** to fully initialize. Don't panic if the environment seems unresponsive at first.

- If you can't find something in the AWS Console:

  - Double-check the instructions.
  - Use your browser's **Find** function (`Ctrl+F` or `Cmd+F`).
  - Sometimes AWS updates its UI or services, and the lab instructions may be slightly outdated. In such cases, **use your judgment or AI tools** to find equivalent steps.

- Some tasks need **a short delay** to complete in the background (e.g., provisioning, syncing, deploying). Be patient. If a command fails, wait 10–20 seconds and try again.
