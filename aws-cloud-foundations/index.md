## 🎯 How to Pass the Course

### Minimum Requirements to Pass the Course (Grade 1)

To earn a **minimum passing grade (1)**, you must **complete all AWS Academy modules** before **week 47**.

#### Stay on Track

- Avoid last-minute work — follow the **weekly schedule** provided.
- You may complete the course at a faster pace if you prefer, as long as it's done before week 47.
- ⚠️ **Strict deadline**: If you miss week 47 deadline, **you will fail the course**. No exceptions.

#### Handwritten Notes for Each Video

You must create **handwritten notes** for every video in all modules. Your notes must include:

1. **The most important topics** from the video.
2. **Answers to the following questions:**
   - a) _What did you learn?_
   - b) _What was unclear?_

#### Submitting Your Notes

- Upload your notes as **PDFs** via following [form](https://forms.cloud.microsoft/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=r0Rp-nzM2EyRVMARMnmJELTaXhmZ3l1Al4wTyiKl20lUNEQ0OVZPVTBENThUTERSUzBOMUFVVFQySy4u).
- The PDF must contain **images of your handwritten notes**.
- File name format (case-sensitive):
  - `moduleXX-lastname-firstname-notes.pdf`
  - **Examples:**
    - `module01-video01-virtanen-matti-notes.pdf`
    - `module05-video05-smith-john-notes.pdf`

> ⚠️ If the file name is incorrect, your submission will be **automatically rejected**. You must resubmit using the correct naming convention.

#### 😠 I hate to write handwritten notes, why do we have to do this?

##### 1. **Deeper Processing**

- Handwriting forces **summarization**, improving understanding.
- Typing leads to **verbatim transcription**, less cognitive effort.
- 📚 _Mueller & Oppenheimer (2014)_
  [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614524581)

##### 2. **Better Memory & Recall**

- Handwriting activates **more brain regions** (motor, visual, memory).
- Leads to **stronger encoding** and long-term retention.
- 📚 _Van der Meer & Van der Weel (2017)_
  [Link](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00706)

##### 3. **Less Distraction**

- Laptops increase **multitasking** and reduce focus.
- 📚 _Sana et al. (2013)_

##### ✅ Summary

| Benefit            | Handwriting | Typing |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------ |
| Deep processing    | ✅          | ❌     |
| Memory retention   | ✅          | ❌     |
| Fewer distractions | ✅          | ❌     |

#### Language

You may write your notes in **Finnish or English**.

### Grades 1 - 5

To aim for a **higher grade (1-5)**, you must **participate in the final exam**. You can take the exam when you have completed the course (notes, all knowledge tests and labs) - you cannot participate on the exam if AWS Academy modules are not completed.

If you take the exam but do not pass, your grade will remain **1**.

### Exam

- Exam is done in [`exam.tuni.fi`](https://sites.tuni.fi/exam/).
- Contains multiple choice questions.
- Consists of questions from modules `01` to `10`.
- Each module has five (`5`) questions
  - `10 modules × 5 questions = 50 questions`
- Questions are chosen randomly so **each student will get a unique exam**.
- Exam will be open in week 43 and link is provided to students.
- You cannot have any extra material with you in the exam.
- Retakes?
  - If you fail the exam, you can retake the exam twice.
  - If you pass the exam, you can retake the exam once.

## Tips for AWS Academy Assignments

- When starting a lab, **it may take 5-10 minutes** to fully initialize. Don't panic if the environment seems unresponsive at first.

- If you can't find something in the AWS Console:

  - Double-check the instructions.
  - Use your browser's **Find** function (`Ctrl+F` or `Cmd+F`).
  - Sometimes AWS updates its UI or services, and the lab instructions may be slightly outdated. In such cases, **use your judgment or AI tools** to find equivalent steps.

- Some tasks need **a short delay** to complete in the background (e.g., provisioning, syncing, deploying). Be patient. If a command fails, wait 10–20 seconds and try again.
