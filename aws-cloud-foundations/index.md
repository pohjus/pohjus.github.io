## ‚úèÔ∏è Tips for AWS Academy Assignments

- When starting a lab, **it may take 5-10 minutes** to fully initialize. Don't panic if the environment seems unresponsive at first.

- If you can't find something in the AWS Console:

  - Double-check the instructions.
  - Use your browser's **Find** function (`Ctrl+F` or `Cmd+F`).
  - Sometimes AWS updates its UI or services, and the lab instructions may be slightly outdated. In such cases, **use your judgment or AI tools** to find equivalent steps.

- Some tasks need **a short delay** to complete in the background (e.g., provisioning, syncing, deploying). Be patient. If a command fails, wait 10‚Äì20 seconds and try again.

- **Take notes** as you go:

  - Write down **what each AWS service does** and **why you used it**.
  - AWS has many acronyms and services - your future self will thank you later.
