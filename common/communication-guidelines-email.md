# Communication

- **Preferred method:** Use **Slack** for communication if it's available.
- **For security-sensitive matters:** Use **email** instead.

### Best Practices for Asking Programming Questions on Email

- Please use `[course identifier]` in your subject line!
- Example [4A00HB30-2002] Question about Assignment 01 / 02 (while-loops)

Why?

1. **Many courses, many students - Teachers often handle several different courses and hundreds of students. Without a clear course code in the subject line, it 's hard to know which course the message relates to, especially if the email only says "Question about assignment."
2. **Inbox filtering and searching** - with `[course identifier]`, emails can be automatically sorted or searched later. For instance, filtering all messages with `[4A00HB30-2002]` helps the teacher group all course-related communication quickly.
3. **Faster responses** - When the teacher instantly knows which course and topic the message concerns, they can answer more efficiently, rather than wasting time trying to identify context.
4. **Professional communication practice** - It teaches students a good habit used in workplaces and academia: structuring subject lines for clarity. This mirrors real-world expectations in professional correspondence.
5. **Consistency** - If everyone follows the same format, communication stays clean and manageable, reducing misunderstandings and lost messages.

### Bad example

```
from: max.power@tuni.fi
subject: help

I do not understand assignments, help.
```

The email is bad because it lacks clarity, context, and professionalism. Here's why:

- Subject line too vague - just "help" doesn't tell the teacher what the issue is.
- No greeting - feels abrupt and impolite.
- No details - "I do not understand assignments" doesn't say which assignment, what part is confusing, or what has already been tried.
- No request - simply says "help" without specifying what kind of help is needed.
- No course name - lack of course name or code means that teacher does not know what course does student belong to

### Good example

Subject: [4A00HB30-2002] Question about Assignment 01 / 02 (while-loops)

Hello,

I'm having difficulties with Assignment 01 / 02 in the course 4A00HB30-2002 Java
Fundamentals. Specifically, I don't understand how to set up the while loop
so that it stops when the user enters 0. I tried adapting the example from
the lecture notes, but my program still runs endlessly.

The assignment instructions are available here:

My current solution attempt is available here:

You can download and run the app with following commands:

git clone https://...
cd foo/bar/assignments/01/02
javac Main.java && java Main

Would it be possible for you to point out what I should focus on,
or could we briefly go through it in the next class?

Best regards,
