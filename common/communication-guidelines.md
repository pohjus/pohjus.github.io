# 💬 Communication

- **Preferred method:** Use **Slack** for communication.
- **For security-sensitive matters:** Use **email** instead.

## Best Practices for Asking Programming Questions on Email

### Bad example

```
from: max.power@tuni.fi
subject: help

I do not understand assignments, help.
```

The email is bad because it lacks clarity, context, and professionalism. Here's why:

- Subject line too vague → just "help" doesn't tell the teacher what the issue is.
- No greeting → feels abrupt and impolite.
- No details → "I do not understand assignments" doesn't say which assignment, what part is confusing, or what has already been tried.
- No request → simply says "help" without specifying what kind of help is needed.
- No course name → lack of course name or code means that teacher does not know what course does student belong to

### Good example

#### Subject line matters!

Please use `[course identifier]` in your subject line!

Subject: [4A00HB30-2002] Question about Assignment 01 / 02 (while-loops)

Hello,

I'm having difficulties with Assignment 01 / 02 in the course 4A00HB30-2002 Java
Fundamentals. Specifically, I don't understand how to set up the while loop
so that it stops when the user enters 0. I tried adapting the example from
the lecture notes, but my program still runs endlessly.

The assignment instructions are available here:

https://...

My current solution attempt is available here:

https://...

You can download and run the app with following commands:

git clone https://...
cd foo/bar/assignments/01/02
javac Main.java && java Main

Would it be possible for you to point out what I should focus on,
or could we briefly go through it in the next class?

Best regards,

Subject: [4A00HB30-2002] Kysymys koskien tehtävää 01 / 02 (while-loops)

Hei,

Minulla on vaikeuksia kurssin 4A00HB30-2002 Java Fundamentals tehtävän 01 / 02
kanssa. En oikein ymmärrä, miten while-silmukka pitäisi rakentaa niin,
että se pysähtyy, kun käyttäjä syöttää arvon 0. Yritin soveltaa kurssimateriaalin
esimerkkiä, mutta ohjelmani jatkaa silti loputtomiin.

Tehtävänanto löytyy täältä:

https://…

Nykyinen ratkaisuyritykseni löytyy täältä:

https://…

Saat ohjelmani käynnistettyä omalla koneellasi seuraavasti:

git clone https://...
cd foo/bar/assignments/01/02
javac Main.java && java Main

Olisiko mahdollista, että voisit osoittaa, mihin minun tulisi keskittyä,
tai että voisimme käydä tämän lyhyesti läpi seuraavalla tunnilla?

Ystävällisesti,

## Best Practices for informing absence from Lecture

If possible, try to inform this via Slack. 

If using e-mail, please use `[course identifier]` in your subject line! Lack of course name or code means that teacher does not know what course does student belong to.

Subject: [4A00HB30-2002] Absence from Lecture on 10.9.2025

Hello,

I wanted to let you know that I won't be able to attend the lecture on 
Tuesday, 10 September, in the course 4A00HB30-2002 Java Fundamentals, because 
I have a doctor's appointment at that time. Is this okay?

Thank you for your understanding.

Hei,

En valitettavasti pääse osallistumaan tiistaina 10. syyskuuta kurssin 
4A00HB30-2002 Java Fundamentals luennolle, koska minulla on tuolloin lääkäriaika.
Onkohan tämä ok?

Ystävällisin terveisin,

### 1️⃣ Be Clear and Concise

- **State Your Objective:** Begin with a clear statement of what you're trying to achieve or the problem you're facing.
- **Assignment Context:** Mention what assignment and exercise you're working on.
- **Provide a Link:** Include a link to the assignment if available.

### 2️⃣ Provide Necessary Details

- **Error Messages:** Include any error messages or output that you're encountering, verbatim.
- **Relevant Code:** Share only the relevant portion of your code that is causing the issue. Use proper formatting.
- **Command Used:** Share the command you used, where you ran it, and what it returned.
- **What You've Tried:** Mention what solutions or debugging steps you've already attempted.
- **GitHub Repository:** Provide a link to your GitHub repo so others can explore the full code context if needed.

### 3️⃣ Format Your Question Properly

- **Code Blocks:** Use Slack's code block (triple backticks ```) for sharing code or error messages to improve readability.
- **Screenshots:** Include screenshots when necessary, but prefer text for logs and code snippets so they can be copied and searched.

### 4️⃣ Tag People and Use Channels Wisely

- **Relevant Channels:** Post your question in the most appropriate channel.
- **Direct Messages:** Use DMs for specific queries, but respect the recipient's time and availability.

### 5️⃣ Follow Up and Give Feedback

- **Update the Thread:** If you solve the issue, post your solution or a summary.
- **Appreciation:** Acknowledge the help you receive. It encourages community support.

### 6️⃣ Respect Everyone's Time

- **Initial Research:** Try solving the problem yourself using documentation or search engines.
- **Be Patient:** Helpers have their own tasks and responsibilities.
- **Reproducibility:** Give exact steps to reproduce the issue, including necessary commands like:

  ```sh
  git clone https://url-to-repository && cd path/to/assignment && compile-command && run-command
  ```

### ✅ Quick Checklist Before You Post

- [ ] Did I explain what I'm trying to do?
- [ ] Did I include error messages and commands?
- [ ] Did I link to my code or GitHub repo?
- [ ] Did I link to the assignment?
- [ ] Did I show what I've tried already?
- [ ] Did I format everything clearly using code blocks?
- [ ] Did I include commands how to reproduce the error?

By following these best practices, you'll make it easier for others to understand and help with your programming questions, leading to more effective problem-solving on Slack.
