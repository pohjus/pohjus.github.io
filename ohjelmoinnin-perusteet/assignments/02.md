# 🧪 Assignment 02

## 📁 Directory Structure

Create each exercise in its own folder:

```
lastname-firstname-assignment02/01/Main.java
lastname-firstname-assignment02/02/Main.java
...
lastname-firstname-assignment02/0n/Main.java
```

So your directory structure could be (_change the name from `opiskelija-olli` to your name_):

```
opiskelija-olli-assignment02
├── 01
│   └── Main.java
├── 02
│   └── Main.java
└── 03
.   └── Main.java
.
```

Use the concepts we've covered in class in your exercises - **don't use advanced features**, even if you already know them.

# Theory: Boolean Algebra

**Boolean algebra** is a branch of algebra that deals with `true` or `false` values (binary: `1` and `0`). It is the foundation of logic in programming.

- **AND (`&&`)**: Result is true only if _both_ conditions are true.
- **OR (`||`)**: Result is true if _at least one_ condition is true.
- **NOT (`!`)**: Reverses the truth value.

**Truth Table:**

| A     | B     | A && B | A \|\| B | !A    |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| true  | true  | true   | true     | false |
| true  | false | false  | true     | false |
| false | true  | false  | true     | true  |
| false | false | false  | false    | true  |

## Recap: User Input Examples

### Using Console

```java
import java.io.Console;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Console c = System.console();

        System.out.println("Enter a number:");
        int number = Integer.parseInt(c.readLine());

        System.out.println("You entered: " + number);
    }
}
```

### Using Scanner

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter a number:");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println("You entered: " + number);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

# 🧩 Exercises

## ✅ Boolean Algebra

1. **Christmas Eve Greeting:** Create a Java program that prints _"Merry Christmas!"_ on Christmas Eve. The program uses two variables, `day` and `month`. You may ask the user for the day and month. (If the date is not Christmas Eve, the program prints nothing.)

   **Sample run:**

   ```text
   Enter day:
   24
   Enter month:
   12
   Merry Christmas!
   ```

   ```text
   Enter day:
   3
   Enter month:
   3
   ```

2. **Dog’s Exceptional Age:** Write a program that asks the user's dog's age. If the dog is younger than 3 years or older than 10 years, the program prints:
   `The dog is of exceptional age.`
   Otherwise, the program prints nothing.

3. **Working Hours:** Write a program that asks the user for the hour of the day. If the hour is between 9 and 17 (inclusive), the program prints `Working hours are in progress!`. Otherwise, it prints nothing.

_Skip extras for now, if time, come back and implement these:_

4. 🤓 **Extra — Summer Months Check:** Write a program that asks the user for the month number (1‑12). If the month is **not** a summer month (June, July or August), print `Not holiday season`. Otherwise, print nothing. Use `||` (OR) and the negation operator `!` in your solution.

5. 🤓 **Extra — Pub Suggestion:** Create a Java program that tells a student to go to a [ale pupi](images/ale-pupi.jpg) if both money and time allow. Ask the user for their amount of money and the current time (hours and minutes). If the time is between **12.00 and 03.29** and the person has **5€ or more**, instruct them to go to the discount pub.

   **Sample run:**

   ```text
   What time is it (h)?
   3
   What time is it (min)?
   29
   How much money do you have (€)?
   5
   Ale pupi is open from 12 - 3.29 every day and a beer costs 5€. Go to the Ale pupi.
   ```

   **Hint:** Break long conditions into variables:

   ```java
   boolean isMoneyOk = money >= 5;
   boolean isTimeOk  = ...;

   if (isMoneyOk && isTimeOk) {
       ...
   }
   ```

   You can also split `isTimeOk` into smaller parts if needed.

## 📦 Variables

6. Write a Java program that **declares** three variables: `int age`, `double number`, `char someChar`. Try to print their values without initializing them. What compiler error do you get? Fix it by initializing the variables.

7. Declare an `int` variable (give it any value) and assign it to a `byte` variable. Use an explicit cast:

   ```java
   byte x = (byte) someInt;
   ```

   When converting from a larger range (e.g., `int`) to a smaller range (`byte`), an explicit cast is required.

   Then create a `byte` variable and assign it to an `int` variable. Is a cast required in this direction?

8. Converting **class types** to **primitive types** is not as straightforward as converting one primitive type to another. The most common class‑to‑primitive conversion is turning a string into a number:

   ```java
   int x    = Integer.parseInt("55");
   double y = Double.parseDouble("5.5");
   ```

   Create an application that takes **two integers** from the user and outputs their division. Remember: if you divide two `int` variables, the result is also `int`. Cast from `int` to `double` to get a precise result. Verify that with inputs `5` and `2` the output is `2.5`.

   Use following user input using `Console`:

   ```java
   int n = Integer.parseInt(c.readLine());
   ```

   What type does `c.readLine()` return? In other words, in what form (what data type) does the user’s input arrive from the console? Answer in your code comments.

## 🔄 Control Structures

9.  Using a **while** loop, write an application that prints the following integer ranges. Create four separate while loops (parts a–d).

        a) 1 → 10
        b) 5 → 15
        c) 10 → 0
        d) every second number from 10 → 0

10. Implement the previous loops with a [**for**](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_for_loop.asp) loop.

11. Implement the previous loops with a [**do‑while**](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-do-while-loop) loop.

What is the principal difference between `while` and `do‑while`? Try a loop whose condition is false; how do the two differ?

```java
int x = 20;
while (x < 1) {
    System.out.println("A");
}

do {
    System.out.println("B");
} while (x < 1);
```

12. Multiplication is familiar to everyone:

```text
2 * 4 = 8
```

You can also compute the product using repeated addition:

```text
2 * 4 ⇒ 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8
```

In general:

```text
n * m = n + n + n … (m times)
```

Write a Java application that asks the user for two numbers and calculates their end result using repeated addition. If the user enters `2` and `4`, compute `2 + 2 + 2 + 2` and print the result to the screen.

**Sample run:**

```text
Enter number1:
2
Enter number2:
3
Product:
6
```

**Hint:**

```java
// calculate 5 x 5
int product = 0;
product = product +  5;       // 0 + 5
product = product +  5;       // 5 + 5
product = product +  5;       // 10 + 5
product = product +  5;       // 15 + 5
product = product +  5;       // 20 + 5
System.out.println(product);  // 25
```

Use a loop in your solution.

13. Create an application that asks the user for a number between 1 and 7. If the user enters anything else, ask again (use a **do‑while** loop).

14. Continue with the same application. Once the number is accepted, print the corresponding weekday (1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday …). Use [**switch‑case**](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_switch.asp).

15. Write a program that asks for a score and outputs a grade according to the table:

| Grade (Latin) | Points  |
| ------------- | ------- |
| _improbatur_  | 0 – 8   |
| _approbatur_  | 9 – 16  |
| _lubenter_    | 17 – 24 |
| _cum laude_   | 25 – 35 |
| _magna_       | 36 – 44 |
| _eximia_      | 45 – 52 |
| _laudatur_    | 53 – 60 |

**Tip:** _Do not_ use `switch‑case` for this one. 🙂

## 🎆 ASCII Graphics using Control Structures

The following pattern‑drawing tasks **must not** use `String.repeat()`. Implement them using loops.

ℹ️ _Note: The tasks are not necessarily in difficulty order._

---

16. Write a program that prints the following pattern. Ask the user for the number of `X`'s. Use a loop to output the characters:

```text
Enter pattern width:
4

XXXX
```

17. Write a program that prints the following **square**. Ask the user for the square’s height. Use a loop.

```text
Enter square height:
4

XXXX
XXXX
XXXX
XXXX
```

18. 🤓 **Extra:** Write a program that prints the following pattern. Ask the user for the height. Use a loop. The pattern's width and height are identical.

```text
Enter pattern height:
5

XXXXX
XX  X
X X X
X  XX
XXXXX
```

Examples:

```text
height = 5

XXXXX
XX  X
X X X
X  XX
XXXXX

height = 6

XXXXXX
XX   X
X X  X
X  X X
X   XX
XXXXXX
```

19. Write a program that prints the following pattern. Ask the user for the height. Use a loop.

```text
X
 X
  X
   X
    X
```

20. Write a program that prints the following pattern. Ask the user for the height. Use a loop.

```text
    X
   X
  X
 X
X
```

## 🪨📃✂️ Rock-Paper-Scissors using Control Structures

21. Implement the classic **Rock‑Paper‑Scissors** game in Java. The game is two‑player: Player 1 chooses rock, paper, or scissors, then Player 2 does the same. The program announces the winner. (Most likely Player 2 will always win here, but don’t worry 😃).

22. Modify the application so the player competes against the computer. The computer randomly chooses rock, paper, or scissors. Use `Math.random`:

```java
// random number in [0, 1[
double x = Math.random();
```

23. Extend the game to _best‑of‑three_. At the end, announce whether the human or the computer won.

24. 🤓 **Extra** Implement the **Rock‑Paper‑Scissors‑Lizard‑Spock** variant. See:
