# üß™ Assignment 03

## üìÅ Directory Structure

Create each exercise in its own folder:

```
lastname-firstname-assignment03/01/Main.java
lastname-firstname-assignment03/02/Main.java
...
lastname-firstname-assignment03/0n/Main.java
```

So your directory structure could be (_change the name from `opiskelija-olli` to your name_):

```
opiskelija-olli-assignment03
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Main.java
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Main.java
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 03
.   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Main.java
.
```

Use the concepts we've covered in class in your exercises - **don't use advanced features**, even if you already know them.

## üß© Exercises

### 1. Name check

Implement an application that asks the user for their name.

If the name is `"Matti"` print:

```
Hello Matti!
```

### 2. String methods

Variables of class types are often called objects. `String` is a class type, and thus variables created from it are objects. An object can have operations (services, methods) that the programmer can use.

Implement an application in which you test (what do these do?) the following services:

- [`charAt(int)`](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#charAt(int)>)
- [`length()`](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#length()>)
- [`trim()`](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#trim()>)

Hint for the last one: create a string that has spaces at the beginning and end.

### 3. Character printing

Implement an application that asks the user for their name and prints each character on its own line:

```
Enter your name: Otto
O
t
t
o
```

### 4. Reverse Order

Translate the previous exercise, but print the characters in reverse order.

### 5. Reverse order and every other char

Implement the previous task (i.e., task 4), but print every other character of the name.

### 6. Appending Strings

What happens when you "add together" the following? Why?
Try it out and explain in comments.

    1 + 2
    "string1" + "string2"
    "string1" + 2
    "string1" + 3.3
    3.3 + "string" + 3.3
    2 + "string2"
    "string1" + 'a'
    'a' + 'b'

### 7. Appending Strings - part 2

Implement an application that asks the user to enter names. Name input should stop when the user enters the string `lopeta`. On each round, the program prints all names entered so far on a single line:

    Enter name:
    Tiina
    Tiina
    Enter name:
    Heli
    TiinaHeli
    Enter name:
    Kalle
    TiinaHeliKalle
    Enter name:
    Pauli
    TiinaHeliKallePauli
    Enter name:
    lopeta

### 8. Palindrome

Implement an application that asks the user for a string. The application reports whether the string is a palindrome or not. Use the String class and a for loop in your solution.

### 9. Palindrome - part 2

Modify the previous task so that palindrome strings are checked in a way that spaces and punctuation marks (`,`, `.`) are ignored, and letter case does not matter. Use [`equalsIgnoreCase`](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#equalsIgnoreCase(java.lang.String)>) for comparison.

For example, the sentence `N√§tin √§√§nesi, sen √§√§nit√§n` should be recognized as a palindrome.

**Do not use** the [`replaceAll`](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#replaceAll(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)>) method to remove spaces or punctuation marks.
Instead, build a cleaned version of the string using only [`charAt(int)`](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#charAt(int)>) and `+` (string concatenation).

The logic should manually filter characters and build a new string containing only letters.

### 10. Loop

Implement an application that asks the user for two integers. The program prints all the numbers between the two values, from smallest to largest.

Example:

```
Enter number 1: 5
Enter number 2: 10
5
6
7
8
9
10

Enter number 1: 2
Enter number 2: -3
-3
-2
-1
0
1
2
```

### 11. Calculator

Implement a calculator application. The program asks for two integers and an operator. It prints the result of the calculation.

Example:

```
Enter number 1:
5
Enter operator:
/
Enter number 2:
2
5 / 2 = 2.5

Enter number 1:
10
Enter operator:
+
Enter number 2:
2
10 + 2 = 12
```

### 12. Random values

In Java, you can generate a random double between `[0, 1[` like this:

```java
double random = Math.random();
```

Implement a Java application that prints 5 random numbers between `[0, 1[`.

Example:

```
0.112312
0.332323
0.233223
0.323232
0.983233
```

### 13. Random values

You can convert a floating point number (double) into an integer (int) via type casting:

```java
double a = 5.89;
int b = (int) a;
System.out.println(b); // 5
```

In type casting, the decimal part is discarded, i.e., rounding happens downwards.
Now implement an application that prints five random integers between 0 and 4.
Use `Math.random()` and type casting.

Example:

```
0
4
4
2
1
```

### 14. Password check

Implement an application that asks the user for a password.

Check that the password is at least 8 characters long, contains at least one digit, one uppercase letter, and one lowercase letter.
If valid, print "Password accepted", otherwise print the reason why it's not accepted.

Tips:

- You can check uppercase and lowercase using:
  - `Character.isLowerCase('k')`
  - `Character.isUpperCase('K')`
- To check for digits:
  - `Character.isDigit('1')`
- Methods with names like `isXXXX()` usually return a boolean value (`true` or `false`)

### 15. Diagram

Use the following code as a base. This program reads a text file called `"ReadText.java"` and prints each line to the console:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.charset.Charset;
import java.io.File;

public class ReadText {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    String textFileName = "ReadText.java";
    List<String> allLines = Files.readAllLines(new File(textFileName).toPath(), Charset.defaultCharset());

    for (int i = 0; i < allLines.size(); i++) {
        String line = allLines.get(i);
        System.out.println(line);
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure the above code works.

Now create a separate text file named `input.txt` containing integers, for example:

```
3
-3
-1
4
0
```

Implement an application that reads the file and prints the following pattern based on the input:

```
   |+++
---|
  -|
   |++++
   |
```

Do not use the `String.repeat` method in your solution.

**This exercise was part of the Tampere University Introduction to Programming course. Do not use the repeat method of the String class in your solution.**

### 16. Shuffle

Implement an application that asks the user for a name:

```
Enter name:
seppo
```

Then the program prints the name with its characters randomly shuffled, e.g.:

```
oepps
```

Use only the concepts introduced in classroom sessions.

### 17. Hangman

Implement a prototype for a hangman application.
The program contains the word to be guessed as a constant (`final` variable).
You can choose the word yourself.
The program starts and prints dashes (`-`) equal to the length of the word:

```
Guess the word
-----
k
Guess the word
k----
i
Guess the word
ki---
s
Guess the word
kiss-
a
Guess the word
kissa
Correct!
```

The program ends when all letters are guessed.

### 18. Hangman: Text file

Place words into a text file. In your program, read the words and randomly choose one to be guessed.
