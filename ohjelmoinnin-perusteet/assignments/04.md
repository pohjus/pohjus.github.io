# 🧪 Assignment 04

## 📁 Directory Structure

Create each exercise in its own folder:

```
lastname-firstname-assignment04/01/Main.java
lastname-firstname-assignment04/02/Main.java
...
lastname-firstname-assignment04/0n/Main.java
```

So your directory structure could be (_change the name from `opiskelija-olli` to your name_):

```
opiskelija-olli-assignment04
├── 01
│   └── Main.java
├── 02
│   └── Main.java
└── 03
.   └── Main.java
.
```

### Tutorial about Arrays

See:

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B10TjOAyBnw

Example of an array:

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       // create an array of size 3. Contains 3 zeros
       // NOTE! The size of the array CANNOT be changed afterwards,
       // once the size is defined, that's what you have.
       int[] array = new int[3];

       // replace the zeros with values 101, 200 and 999
       array[0] = 101;
       array[1] = 200;
       array[2] = 999;

       // print the values
       System.out.println(array[0]);
       System.out.println(array[1]);
       System.out.println(array[2]);

       // create the array, define its size and assign values in one line
       int[] another = {3, 4, 5, 6};

       // array length
       System.out.println(another.length);  // 4
    }
}
```

1. Implement a program where you store the numbers 12, 99, and 32 in an array. Print the first (12) and the last number (32) to the screen.

Print the length of the array.

Implement an application that prints all values in the array (12, 99, 32) using a `for` loop.

2. Implement an application that prints all values in the array (from task 1) in reverse order using a `for` loop.

3. Implement an application that contains a `String` array with `n` number of people’s names (you can decide the value of `n` yourself — no need to ask it from the user). Add some names to the array. Print every other name using a `for` loop.

4. Implement a program that asks the user for ten integers and stores them in an array (using a `for` loop). Finally, print the sum of the values in the array to the screen. Use a second `for` loop to calculate the sum.

Example:

```sh
Enter ten numbers:
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
Sum of entered numbers: 10
```

5. Modify task 3 so that the value `n` is asked from the user. Also ask the names from the user. Store the names in an array. The program prints the longest name (the one with the most characters).

6. The following stores a random floating-point number between `[0,1[` into a variable:

```java
double random = Math.random();
```

Implement an application that prints a random integer between 0–9. Use type casting.

Now implement an application that randomly prints “rock”, “paper”, or “scissors”.
You are not allowed to use if or switch statements.

7. Implement the following application:

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(args[0]);  // <- Print array values
        System.out.println(args[1]);  // <- Print array values
    }
}
```

Compile

    javac Main.java

Run

    java Main taikaviitta roopeankka

Here, taikaviitta and roopeankka are so-called command-line arguments. These inputs provided by the user at launch are automatically stored in the args array:

    // Java does this for you:
    String[] args = new String[2];
    args[0] = "taikaviitta";
    args[1] = "roopeankka";

Now implement an application that accepts basic arithmetic operations, for example:

    java Calculator 1 + 2
    result = 3

Use command-line arguments.

Support operations: -, +, /, and x for multiplication (use x instead of \* — see below).
You can convert a string to an integer like this:

```java
int number = Integer.parseInt("1");
```

If you want to use `*`:

When using a command like java Calculator 3 _ 3, the asterisk _ does not work as expected because the shell processes it before your Java program receives it.

Why this happens:

- Shell expansion: On Unix-like systems (e.g., Bash), _ is a wildcard that matches all files in the current directory. The shell replaces _ with matching filenames before executing the command.
  Example: rm _.class or del _.class removes all .class files.
  So \* is reserved for the shell.
- Result: Your Java program gets unexpected extra arguments (filenames), causing errors or unpredictable behavior.

macOS:

```bash
java Calculator 3 \* 3
java Calculator 3 '*' 3
java Calculator 3 "*" 3
```

CMD:

```cmd
java Calculator 3 "*" 3
```

PowerShell (not tested):

```ps
java Calculator 3 --% * 3
```

8. Implement a Java application that contains an array of 10 random integers between 1–100 (use Math.random() to generate the numbers). The application checks if the array contains a number provided by the user. Accept the number as a command-line argument.

Example

    java App 50
    Found!

Use linear search.

## Methods

See:

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCgOESMQe44
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1htVG3xP5Y
    https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods.asp
    https://ohjelmointi-20.mooc.fi/osa-2/4-metodit

Example of different kind of methods:

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // method that returns nothing, prints something
        doIt1();

        // method that returns nothing, but takes number 2 as an argument
        doIt2(2);

        // method that returns an integer
        System.out.println( doIt3() );

        // method that returns an integer and takes number 5 as an argument
        System.out.println( doIt4(5) );

        // method that returns an integer and takes numbers 2 and 3 as arguments
        System.out.println( doIt5(2, 3) );
    }

    // Method with no arguments and no return value (void)
    public static void doIt1() {
        System.out.println(1);
    }

    // Method with one int argument and no return value (void)
    public static void doIt2(int x) {
        System.out.println(x);
    }

    // Method with return value (int) and no arguments
    public static int doIt3() {
        return 3;
    }

    // Method with return value (int) and one argument (int)
    public static int doIt4(int x) {
        x--;
        return x;
    }

    // Method with return value (int) and two arguments (int)
    public static int doIt5(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

9. Use the following as a base:

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
    public static void printName() {

    }
}
```

Modify the `printName` method so that it prints your own name. Call the method from the main method. The program should print your name to the console.

10. Use the following as a base:

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
    public static void printGreeting() {

    }

    public static void printName() {

    }
}
```

Modify the given code so that printName prints your name and printGreeting prints the text "Hello ". Call both methods from the main method. The output of the program should be for example "Hello Matt".

11. Use the following as a base:

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
    public static void printGivenName(String x) {

    }
}
```

Ask the user for a name in the main method. Pass the entered name to the printGivenName method, which then prints it. Example program output:

```bash
Enter name:
Jeppe
Jeppe
```

12. Use the following as a base:

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
    public static String returnDate() {

    }
}
```

Modify the returnDate method so that it returns the string "14.9.2021". Print this returned text in the main method. The actual date does not need to be correct—returning, any string is sufficient.

13. Implement a Calculator program that adds two numbers together. You can ask the numbers from the user in the main method. The program includes a method calculate that performs the addition. The method receives two integers as parameters and returns their sum. Print the result in the main method.

14. Implement a method that receives a character (char) and an amount (int) as parameters. The method prints the character to the screen the specified number of times. If you give the method 'X' and 3, it prints 'XXX'. Test it. (Use a for loop in your solution)

15. Implement the same as in the previous task, but this time the method returns a String that contains the character the specified number of times. Test it. (Use a for loop in your solution)

16. Implement a program that prints the following square. Ask the height from the user. Reuse the method from task 14 or 15.

```bash
Enter the height of the shape
4
XXXX
XXXX
XXXX
XXXX
```

17. The following program attempts to sum 5 + 5 and print the result. Why doesn’t the program compile? How would you fix it so that all methods can access the same variables (a, b, sum)? All methods are of type void and should not receive arguments—don’t change that.

```bash
class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        setA();
        setB();
        addTogether();
        printResult();
    }

    public static void setA() {
        int a = 5;
    }

    public static void setB() {
        int b = 5;
    }

    public static void addTogether() {
        int sum = a + b;
    }

    public static void printResult() {
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```

Tips

If you write:

```java
if (1 < 2) {
   int x = 5;
}
System.out.println(x);
```

This won't work because variable x is defined inside the if block, and isn't visible outside of it.

But this works:

```java
int x = 0;
if (1 < 2) {
   x = 5;
}
System.out.println(x);
```

To make a variable visible to all methods in a class, where should you define it? Once you find the correct place, use the static keyword in the variable declaration.

18. Implement a class MyString with a method replaceAll that performs a search-replace on the given string.

```java
String s = MyString.replaceAll("abc:abc:", 'a', "hello");
System.out.println(s); // hellobc:hellobc:

String s = MyString.replaceAll("jussi,kalle", ',', "hey");
System.out.println(s); // jussiheykalle

String s = MyString.replaceAll("heyhey", 'y', "there");
System.out.println(s); // hetherere
```

The method searches the given string (e.g. "abc:abc:") for a specific character (e.g. ':') and replaces every occurrence with the provided string (e.g. "hello").

Implement replaceAll using a for loop, charAt, etc. Do not use Java’s built-in replaceAll method.

19. Implement the method boolean isPalindrome(String original) that returns whether the given string is a palindrome. Test it.

20. Implement the method boolean isPalindrome(String original, boolean includeWhiteSpaces), where the second argument determines whether spaces are taken into account. If true, spaces are included normally in the palindrome check. If false, spaces are removed before comparison.

21. Implement the method

```java
public static int getRandom(int min, int max)
```

in the class MyMath. The method returns a random integer between [min, max], where min and max are positive integers. Use Math.random() in the implementation.

22. Implement a game where the player tries to place their game piece on a game board. The game board is a path covered with cards:

```bash
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
```

When the player places their piece on one of the positions, all cards are revealed. A card may be empty or contain a “bomb”. If the card contains a bomb (B), the player loses (P); otherwise, the player wins.

Example:

```bash
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
Enter player position:
5
[ ][ ][ ][ ][P]
Cards are flipped:
[B][ ][B][ ][P]
Player won!
```

The player can define the board size. The bomb positions are randomized. One third of the board will have bomb cards.

Another example:

```bash
Enter board size:
5
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
Enter player position:
1
[P][ ][ ][ ][ ]
Cards are flipped:
[BP][ ][ ][B][ ]
Player lost!
```

Use the previously implemented getRandom(..) method from task 21.
