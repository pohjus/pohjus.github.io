## üí¨ Communication

- Course communication is done in **Slack**.
- See [communication guidelines](https://github.com/pohjus/common-course-assets/blob/main/communication-guidelines.md).

Slack is used because it's more representative of what you'll encounter in the software industry.

- Slack is heavily used in software companies, startups, and open-source projects.
- Many modern dev teams use Slack integrated with GitHub, Jira, and CI/CD pipelines - tools we also use in development workflows.

‚ö†Ô∏è Privacy Notice ‚Äì Use of Slack in This Course

Slack is not an official university tool. It is provided by an external service, and any information you share is processed outside the university's systems.

Never share

- Your student ID or other personal identifiers
- Contact details (email, phone, address)
- Login credentials or passwords
- Any confidential project, company, or research data
- Sensitive personal information about yourself or others

| Exercise completion | Bonus points |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| **70 % ‚Äì < 80 %**   | +1 pt        |
| **80 % ‚Äì < 90 %**   | +2 pts       |
| **90 % ‚Äì 100 %**    | +3 pts       |

#### Exam Scoring

| Grade | Minimum raw score | % of max (24 pts) |
| ----- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **1** | 9.6 pts           | 40 %              |
| **2** | 14.4 pts          | 60 %              |
| **3** | 16.8 pts          | 70 %              |
| **4** | 19.2 pts          | 80 %              |
| **5** | 21.6 pts          | 90 %              |

The **maximum raw score** is **24 points**.

# üß† AI Use Policy

‚úÖ Allowed:

- Asking AI to explain a concept (e.g., "What is a loop?")
- Asking AI to give you a simple example to study and learn from
- Using AI to clarify theory or terminology

‚ùå Not allowed:

- Asking AI to solve your assignment tasks for you
- Copy-pasting AI-generated code into your submission

Why?

If you skip the building phase now, you'll be unable to:

- Understand the code you work with in later courses
- Spot mistakes in AI-generated code when you are expected to review it
- Develop the problem-solving skills that make you a real programmer

In the future, the developer's role may be more about validating AI-generated code than writing it from scratch. But effective validation requires deep expertise, expertise you can only gain by building software manually yourself!

If you use AI, use [**Programming Learning Coach**](https://chatgpt.com/share/68988de7-1bf8-8008-9b02-1c1b8ee4482a), it should be instructed to NOT give you code directly (although this is not guaranteed, use it wisely!):

> This is an interactive programming tutor that teaches by asking questions, giving hints, and explaining concepts - never giving full code. Helps students think through problems, not just copy solutions.

‚ö†Ô∏è Privacy Notice - Use of ChatGPT in This Course
