### Grading Options

#### Option A: **Grade 1 - Exercises only (attendance required)**

- Complete at least **40%** of the given exercises and return them correctly ‚Üí you will receive **Grade 1**.
  - [Exercise Point Guidelines](https://github.com/pohjus/common-course-assets/blob/main/exercise-points-guidelines.md)
  - Upload via [File Upload Form](https://www.dropbox.com/request/WenoWd5sGzH4f8Fv0hIL)
  - Mark your progress in Google Sheets

#### Option B: **Grades 1-5 - Exercises + Exam (attendance required)**

- Complete at least **40%** of the exercises (see above).
- Participate in the exam.
- Your final grade (1-5) is based on the exam.
- If you fail the exam but have completed the required exercises, you will still receive **Grade 1**.

#### Option C: **Grades 0-5 - Exam only (no attendance required)**

- Participate in the exam.
- Grade depends solely on exam performance (0‚Äì5).
- Failing the exam = failing the course.

#### Comparison Table

| Option                  | Attendance | Exercises Required | Exam Required | Possible Grades | Notes                                                             |

### Bonus-Point System

Bonus points are awarded based on the percentage of exercises completed **before** the exam. They apply **only** if you attend in-person teaching.

| Exercise completion | Bonus points |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| **70 % ‚Äì < 80 %**   | +1 pt        |
| **80 % ‚Äì < 90 %**   | +2 pts       |
| **90 % ‚Äì 100 %**    | +3 pts       |

#### Exam Scoring

| Grade | Minimum raw score | % of max (24 pts) |
| ----- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **1** | 9.6 pts           | 40 %              |
| **2** | 14.4 pts          | 60 %              |
| **3** | 16.8 pts          | 70 %              |

> You must first achieve at least **9.6 raw points** to pass; bonus points are added **after** this threshold is met.

# üß† AI Use Policy

According to the Arene's [AI traffic light model](https://arene.fi/wp-content/uploads/PDF/2024/Teko√§lysuositukset/ARENE_AI_liikennevalomalli%20.pdf?_t=1730467050), we follow the yellow rule: _"The use of AI is allowed, but it must be disclosed.‚Äù_ - with the following restrictions:

‚úÖ Allowed:

- Asking AI to explain a concept (e.g., "What is a loop?")
- Asking AI to give you a simple example to study and learn from
- Using AI to clarify theory or terminology

‚ùå Not allowed:

- Asking AI to solve your assignment tasks for you
- Copy-pasting AI-generated code into your submission

Notice also that all of the assignments have a license:

> The material may **not** be used, in whole or in part, to **train, fine-tune, prompt, or otherwise feed into any generative artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) system**, expect for the author.

## Why the restrictions?

If you skip the building phase now, you'll be unable to:

- Understand the code you work with in later courses
- Spot mistakes in AI-generated code when you are expected to review it
- Develop the problem-solving skills that make you a real programmer

In the future, the developer's role may be more about validating AI-generated code than writing it from scratch. But effective validation requires deep expertise, expertise you can only gain by building software manually yourself!

If you use AI, use [**Programming Learning Coach**](https://chatgpt.com/share/68988de7-1bf8-8008-9b02-1c1b8ee4482a), it should be instructed to NOT give you code directly (although this is not guaranteed, use it wisely!):

> This is an interactive programming tutor that teaches by asking questions, giving hints, and explaining concepts - never giving full code. Helps students think through problems, not just copy solutions.
