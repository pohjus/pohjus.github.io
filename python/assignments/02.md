# 🧪 Assignment 02

## 📁 Directory Structure

Create each exercise in its own folder:

```
lastname-firstname-assignment02/e01.py
lastname-firstname-assignment02/e02.py
...
lastname-firstname-assignment02/e23.py
```

So your directory structure could be (_change the name from `opiskelija-olli` to your name_):

```
opiskelija-olli-assignment02
├── e01.py
├── e02.py
├── e03.py
...
├── e23.py
```

⚠️ Use the concepts we've covered in class in your exercises - **don't use advanced features**, even if you already know them.

## 🚀 Submitting Your Work

1. Zip your `lastname-firstname-assignment02` directory to `lastname-firstname-assignment02.zip`. If you do not know how to zip, see [instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/.zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5).
2. To submit your exercises to the teacher use [dropbox file upload](https://www.dropbox.com/request/WenoWd5sGzH4f8Fv0hIL).
3. Mark your exercises in Google Sheets (link in Slack)
4. Be prepared to participate on code review where you may have to explain your solutions in the class.
5. Be on time on lectures, **latecomers do not get points**.
6. See general [guidelines](https://github.com/pohjus/common-course-assets/blob/main/exercise-points-guidelines.md) for the exercises.

### Assignment 04: While Loops – Counting

Use four while loops to output

- 1 → 10
- 5 → 15
- 10 → 0
- every second number from 10 → 0

### Assignment 05: For Loops

Repeat previsous using for loops and `range()`.

### Assignment 06: Multiplication Using Sum

Ask two integers. Multiply them by repeated addition:

```python
Enter first number:
2
Enter second number:
4
Result:
8
```

### Assignment 07: Input Validation with Loop

Using match-case (Python 3.10+), map 1–7 to weekdays.
So ask number from 1 - 7 and then output `monday` (1), `tuesday`(2) etc.

### Assignment 08: Input Validation with Loop

Ask for score (0–60). Print grade according to:

| Grade      | Score Range |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| improbatur | 0–8         |
| approbatur | 9–16        |
| lubenter   | 17–24       |
| cum laude  | 25–35       |
| magna      | 36–44       |
| eximia     | 45–52       |
| laudatur   | 53–60       |

Do not use match-case.

### Assignment 09: Input Validation with Loop

Ask user for a number 1–7. Keep asking until valid input is given.

### Assignment 10: One Line of Xs

Ask width. Print one line:

```bash
Enter width:
4
XXXX
```

Use `for` or `while` to do the repetition.

### Assignment 11: Square

Use `for` or `while` to do the repetition.

### Assignment 12: Diagonal Left to Right

Ask height:

```bash
Enter height:
4
X
 X
  X
   X
```

Use `for` or `while` to do the repetition.

### Assignment 13: Diagonal Right to Left

Ask height:

```bash
Enter height:
4
   X
  X
 X
X
```

Use `for` or `while` to do the repetition.
