## 📁 Directory Structure

Create each exercise in its own folder:

```
lastname-firstname-assignment04/e01.py
lastname-firstname-assignment04/e02.py
...
lastname-firstname-assignment04/e23.py
```

So your directory structure could be (_change the name from `opiskelija-olli` to your name_):

```
opiskelija-olli-assignment04
├── e01.py
├── e02.py
├── e03.py
...
├── e23.py
```

⚠️ Use the concepts we've covered in class in your exercises - **don't use advanced features**, even if you already know them.

## 🚀 Submitting Your Work

1. Zip your `lastname-firstname-assignment03` directory to `lastname-firstname-assignment03.zip`. If you do not know how to zip, see [instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/.zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5).
2. To submit your exercises to the teacher use [dropbox file upload](https://www.dropbox.com/request/WenoWd5sGzH4f8Fv0hIL).
3. Mark your exercises in Google Sheets (link in Moodle)
4. Be prepared to participate on code review where you may have to explain your solutions in the class.
5. Be on time on lectures, **latecomers do not get points**.
6. See general [guidelines](https://github.com/pohjus/common-course-assets/blob/main/exercise-points-guidelines.md) for the exercises.

## 🧩 Exercises

### Assignment 01: Simple Function

Write a function called `greet()` that prints `"Hello, world!"`.
Call the function.

Output of your app:

    Hello, world!

---

### Assignment 02: Function with Parameters

Write a function `greet(name)` that prints `"Hello, <name>!"`.
Ask the user for their name and call the function.

Example flow of your app

    Give name: Jack
    Hello, Jack!

Or

    Give name: Iiro
    Hello, Iiro!

---

### Assignment 03: Return Value

Write a function `add(a, b)` that returns the sum of two numbers.
Ask the user for two numbers, call the function, and print the result.

Example flow of your app

    Give number 1: 5
    Give number 2: 10
    Sum: 15

---

### Assignment 04: Even or Odd

Write a function `is_even(n)` that returns `True` if `n` is even, otherwise `False`.
Ask the user for a number and print the result. See [tutorial for even / odd](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/odd-even).

Example flow:

    Give number: 4
    Number 4 is even.

Or

    Give number: 3
    Number 3 is odd.

---

### Assignment 05: Maximum of Three

Write a function `maximum(a, b, c)` that returns the largest of the three numbers.
Ask the user for three numbers and use the function to find and print the max. Implement the functionality of max using `if`.

Example

    Give number 1: 5
    Give number 2: 10
    Give number 3: 2
    Largest number is 10.

---

### Assignment 06: Average

Write a function `average(numbers)` that takes a `list` of numbers and returns the average.
Ask the user to enter 5 numbers and print the result using the function. Use for loop and list in your solution.

Example

    Give number 1: 5
    Give number 2: 5
    Give number 3: 5
    Give number 4: 10
    Give number 5: 10
    Average is 7.

---

### Assignment 07: Multiplication Table

Write a function `print_table(n)` that prints the multiplication table of number `n` from 1 to 10. Ask `n` from user.

Example

    Give number: 5
    1 x 5 = 5
    2 x 5 = 10
    3 x 5 = 15
    ..
    ..
    10 x 5 = 50

---

### Assignment 08: Count Vowels

Write a function `count_vowels(text)` that counts and returns the number of vowels in a string.
Ask the user for a string and print the result. You can get one character from string using indexes:

```python
name = "jack"
print(name[0]) # j
```

Example:

    Give name: Hannah
    Number of vowels: 2

---

### Assignment 09: Temperature Converter

Write a function `celsius_to_fahrenheit(c)` that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Ask the user for a Celsius value and print the Fahrenheit equivalent.

---

### Assignment 10: Calculator

Write functions for `add(a, b)`, `subtract(a, b)`, `multiply(a, b)`, and `divide(a, b)`.
Ask the user for two numbers and an operation, then print the result.

Example:

    Number 1: 5
    Number 2: 5
    Operator: +
    Result is: 5 + 5 = 10

---

### Assignment 11: Word Counter

    Give string: Hello Hannah, what's up?
    Number of Words: 4

---

### Assignment 12: List Filter

Write a function `filter_even(numbers)` that returns a list of only even numbers from the given list.
Ask the user for numbers and print the result. Ask positive numbers until negative is given:

Example:

    Number: 5
    Number: 10
    Number: 3
    Number: 7
    Number: -1
    Odd numbers: [5, 3, 7]

---

### Assignment 13: Argument Defaults

Write a function `say_hello(name="friend")` that prints `"Hello, <name>"`. Call it with and without an argument. Call it with argument.

---

### Assignment 14: Print Function

Create a function `print(character, amount)` that outputs the given character
amount of times. So if

```python
print("x", 5)
```

It will output

```bash
xxxxx
```

Use while or for loop for the iteration in the function.

---

### Assignment 15: ASCII Square

Implement an app that asks from the user a height of an ascii square:

```bash
give height:
5
```

Then the app outputs a square that is the size of then given height:

```
XXXX
XXXX
XXXX
XXXX
```

Use the previous function `print` in your solution.

---

### Assignment 16: ASCII Square 2

Implement an app that asks from the user a height of an ascii square:

```bash
give height:
5
```

Then the app outputs a square that is the size of then given height, but this time the square looks like:

```
XXXX
X  X
X  X
XXXX
```

Use the previous function `print` in your solution.
