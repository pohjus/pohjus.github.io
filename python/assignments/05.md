# 🧪 Assignment 05

## 📁 Directory Structure

Create each exercise in its own folder:

```
lastname-firstname-assignment05/e01.py
lastname-firstname-assignment05/e02.py
...
lastname-firstname-assignment05/e23.py
```

So your directory structure could be (_change the name from `opiskelija-olli` to your name_):

```
opiskelija-olli-assignment05
├── e01.py
├── e02.py
├── e03.py
...
├── e23.py
```
