## 📁 Directory Structure

Create each exercise in its own folder:

```
lastname-firstname-assignment05/e01.py
lastname-firstname-assignment05/e02.py
...
lastname-firstname-assignment05/e23.py
```

So your directory structure could be (_change the name from `opiskelija-olli` to your name_):

```
opiskelija-olli-assignment05
├── e01.py
├── e02.py
├── e03.py
...
├── e23.py
```

⚠️ Use the concepts we've covered in class in your exercises - **don't use advanced features**, even if you already know them.

## 🚀 Submitting Your Work

1. Zip your `lastname-firstname-assignment04` directory to `lastname-firstname-assignment05.zip`. If you do not know how to zip, see [instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/.zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5).
2. To submit your exercises to the teacher use [dropbox file upload](https://www.dropbox.com/request/WenoWd5sGzH4f8Fv0hIL).
3. Mark your exercises in Google Sheets (link in Slack)
4. Be prepared to participate on code review where you may have to explain your solutions in the class.
