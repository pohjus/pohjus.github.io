- **Resources:** You will have full access to the [Python book](python.pdf) (PDF)
- **Tools:**
  - Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
  - Python transpiler
- **Internet Access:** No internet connection will be available during the exam.
- **Time**:
  - **2 h 55 min** OR if having health condition, then **3h 55 min.**
  - You must do the exam between time period of week 43 - 47

**Extra Points System:**

- Additional points are awarded based on the percentage of Assignment completed prior to the exam. These points are awarded **only if you participated physically in class.**
  - [**70%, 80%[** of Assignment completed: **+1 point**
  - [**80%, 90%[** of Assignment completed: **+2 points**
  - [**90%, 100%]** of Assignment completed: **+3 points\*\*

**Exam Grading Scale:**

| Grade | Minimum Points Required | Percentage |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| 1     | 9.6                     | 40%        |
| 2     | 14.4                    | 60%        |
| 3     | 16.8                    | 70%        |
