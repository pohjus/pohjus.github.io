# üß™ Assignment 01

## üìÅ Directory Structure

Create each exercise in its own folder:

```
lastname-firstname-assignment01/e01.py
lastname-firstname-assignment01/e02.py
...
lastname-firstname-assignment01/e23.py
```

So your directory structure could be (_change the name from `opiskelija-olli` to your name_):

```
opiskelija-olli-assignment01
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ e01.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ e02.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ e03.py
...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ e23.py
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Use the concepts we've covered in class in your exercises - **don't use advanced features**, even if you already know them.

## üöÄ Submitting Your Work
